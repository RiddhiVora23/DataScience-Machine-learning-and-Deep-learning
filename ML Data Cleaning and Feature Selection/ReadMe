ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection
Problem Statement: Implementing a Dataset-Bank Personal Loan Modeling for predictive learning, analyzing the data's accuracy, and identifying the key features.

Abstract
This dataset contains information about 5000 customers, including demographics, banking relationships, and responses to a personal loan campaign. Only 9.6% of these clients accepted the loan. The key objective is to clean the data, perform feature selection, and build predictive models.

Data Attributes
ID: Customer ID
Age: Customer's age
Experience: Years of professional experience
Income: Annual income ($000)
ZIP Code: Home ZIP code
Family: Family size
CCAvg: Avg. monthly credit card spending ($000)
Education: Education level (1: Undergrad, 2: Graduate, 3: Advanced/Professional)
Mortgage: Value of house mortgage ($000)
Personal Loan: Accepted personal loan (1: Yes, 0: No)
Securities Account: Has securities account (1: Yes, 0: No)
CD Account: Has certificate of deposit account (1: Yes, 0: No)
Online: Uses internet banking (1: Yes, 0: No)
Credit Card: Uses bank's credit card (1: Yes, 0: No)
Key Steps
Data Loading and Initial Inspection

Import libraries and dataset
Check data types and descriptive statistics
Data Cleaning

Identify and handle negative values in 'Experience'
Check and handle missing values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Plot density curves for numeric variables
Correlation matrix to understand dependencies
Feature Selection

OLS Regression to identify significant features
Permutation Importance with Random Forest
Data Splitting

Split data into training and test sets
Model Building and Evaluation

Logistic Regression
XGBoost Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Assess model performance with confusion matrix and accuracy scores
Outlier Detection and Handling

Identify and remove outliers in 'CCAvg' and 'Mortgage'
Imputation

Use median, mean, and mode imputation to handle missing values
Conclusion
The analysis revealed that all independent variables are significant, with 'Income' having the most impact on loan acceptance.
